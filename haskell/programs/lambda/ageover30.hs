-- write a haskell program that takes in a list of tuples containing a person's name and age and returns the names of all the people in the list who are over a certain age threshold

checkAge :: Int -> [(String, Int)] -> [String]
checkAge threshold list = map fst $ filter (\(_,age) -> age > threshold) list
